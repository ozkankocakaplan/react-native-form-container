            lastName: "Please enter your last name",
          };
          const result = formContainerRef.current?.validate(errorMessages);
          console.log(result);

| formId           | PropTypes.string                                                                                     |
| formContainerRef | PropTypes.oneOfType([ PropTypes.func, PropTypes.shape({ current: PropTypes.instanceOf(Element) }) ]) |

## Form Validation

To trigger form validation, use the validate method of the form container reference. This method checks the validity of the fields and returns appropriate error messages for invalid fields.

```sh
const result = formContainerRef.current?.validate(errorMessages);
console.log(result);
```

## Error Messages

You can pass error messages as an object to the validate method for each input component. For example:

```sh
const errorMessages = {
  firstName: "Please enter your first name",
  lastName: "Please enter your last name",
};
```

### validate(errorMessages)

Method: `validate(errorMessages: object) -> boolean`

This method validates the validity of inputs in the form.

#### Parameters:

- `errorMessages`: An object. Each key represents an input's identifier (ID), and its value is an error message.

#### Return Value:

- `true`: If all inputs are valid.
- `false`: If at least one input is invalid or the `errorMessages` parameter is not a valid object.

#### Example Usage:

```javascript
const errorMessages = {
  firstName: "Please enter your first name",
  lastName: "Please enter your last name",
};

const result = formContainerRef.current?.validate(errorMessages);
```
